            "The tech events featured in this list take place throughout the year and cover a wide range of different industries — from SaaS and FinTech to startup events and more. To better navigate this list, let’s briefly review the different events you’ll see.\n",
            "Conferences: Both IRL and virtual conferences powered by virtual event software are the backbone of the tech events industry and can be both B2C and B2B events. They are held to educate, inform, or train attendees.\n",
            "Trade shows: Trade shows give companies in a specific industry the opportunity to showcase their products and services. Whereas most conferences are open to the public, trade shows usually require a screening process for buyers, company reps, and the press.\n",
            "Summits: Though “summit” can be interchangeable with “conference,” summits tend to be smaller and are composed of higher-level executives. In other instances, summits function exactly like conferences.\n",
            "Seminars: You can think of seminars as mini-conferences that are much smaller in scope and sometimes only last one day.\n",
            "Looking ahead to 2024, Bizzabo research uncovered that 85% of event organizers plan to host at least three in-person events, with 35% planning to host at least 10. These findings reflect a study from PCMA, which found that nearly 70% of event organizers were planning in-person events for the second and third quarters of 2022.\n",
            "That said, event organizers continue to embrace virtual elements. Our survey found that 68% of event organizers plan to have a virtual component at their next in-person event. Similarly, PCMA’s study found that one out of two planners worked on hybrid events so attendees could attend according to their preferences.\n",
